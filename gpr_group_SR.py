# Combine the GPR-Group prediction together with SR/SH algorithm.
# the groups are formulated using Kmeans algorithm (assume groups are fixed for now).
# Each round, one choose one group according to SR algorithm. 
# Goal: Recommend the best group.
# Baseline: groups are randomly chosen.

# We consider the same setting as shown in gpr_group_test.py
